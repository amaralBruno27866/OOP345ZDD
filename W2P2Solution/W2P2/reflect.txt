In this workshop we made use of the movement builder, this is a new concept that I had never seen or used, if I understand correctly, it must "steal" the resources of an object and then set the members of that object to default values, this seems ensure that the source object does not release resources if it is destroyed, I also saw the movement assignment operator, another new concept, this already does the opposite, it must release any resources that the destination object may have, so it takes the resources from the source object and then sets its values to the default.

If I understand correctly, this ensures that resources are used more efficiently when copying data and this can improve software performance when we are dealing with a considerable amount of data.
